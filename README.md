# 🛒 Walmart Sales Data Analysis

## 📌 Overview

This project explores sales data from three Walmart branches in Myanmar (Mandalay, Yangon, and Naypyitaw). The goal is to uncover insights about product performance, customer behavior, and sales trends, using SQL.

I performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis to answer business questions like:
- Which product lines generate the most revenue?
- What times of day are the busiest?
- How does customer type affect revenue?

## 📁 Data Source

The dataset is inspired by the [Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting), but uses a simplified structure with 1,000 rows and 17 columns. The data contains transaction-level details for three branches.

## 🔧 Methods and Tools

- SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- Data wrangling
- Feature engineering (e.g., extracting day, time, month)
- Aggregation, grouping, subqueries, window functions

## 📊 Key Insights

- The [product line] was the top-selling across all branches.
- Most sales happen in the [Afternoon/Morning].
- Female customers purchased more in total, but male customers spent more on average.
- Branch [X] has the highest gross income.

## 📌 Business Questions Answered

(Then you can list the questions you answered — you already have a good list)

## 📁 File Structure

- `README.md` – This file
- `SQL_queries.sql` – All SQL queries used for the analysis
- `walmart_sales.csv` – Dataset used for the project

## ✅ Conclusion

This project helped solidify my understanding of SQL for data analysis, including grouping, filtering, joins, and window functions. I also learned how to extract time-based features and draw meaningful business insights from transaction data.
